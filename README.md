# 🛒 FitCheck AI – Personalized Product Fit Scoring for Smarter Shopping

## 👋 Introduction

**FitCheck AI** is an intelligent shopping assistant designed to help users make better purchase decisions with confidence. In today’s world of online shopping, customers are overwhelmed with too many options, confusing reviews, and generic recommendations. A product rated 4.5 stars might still be a poor fit for *you* — depending on your lifestyle, location, or personal preferences.

Our solution solves this problem by offering **personalized, AI-powered product fit scoring**, while seamlessly integrating with Walmart’s product ecosystem.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Shoppers often face decision fatigue and distrust due to:
- Fake or noisy product reviews
- Conflicting user opinions
- Lack of personalization
- Difficulty comparing cross-platform products
- Uncertainty in quality, usability, or value

Customers want quick, reliable, and **personalized** recommendations — not one-size-fits-all ratings.

## 💡 Our Solution

**FitCheck AI** provides users with:
- A simple interface to **paste a product link** (from Amazon, Flipkart, etc.) or describe what they’re looking for
- An AI engine that extracts, filters, and summarizes product reviews from public sources
- A short personalization quiz (e.g. purpose, budget, climate)
- A **Fit Score** out of 100 that reflects how well the product fits *that individual user*
- A detailed, summarized breakdown of **pros, cons, and user sentiments**
- Recommendations for **better-fitting or more trusted options available at Walmart** — online or nearby

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **Input**: 
   - User enters a product name, URL, or query (e.g. “Bluetooth headphones under $100 for workouts”)
   - Optional: allow voice or image input in future

2. **Review Analysis**:
   - Scrape public review data from safe sources
   - Filter out fake/spam/low-quality reviews
   - Use NLP to summarize core themes and sentiment

3. **Personalization**:
   - Ask user a few short questions: usage, weather, budget, importance factors
   - Use location to adapt for relevance (e.g. cold-weather compatibility)

4. **Fit Score Generation**:
   - AI generates a numeric Fit Score (0–100)
   - Score is based on user context + review data + product metadata
   - Gives clear reasoning: “Good for sound, poor for battery in winter use”

5. **Walmart Recommendation**:
   - Show Walmart listings with higher Fit Scores
   - Prioritize in-store or nearby stock availability
   - Push Walmart-first shopping experience

> - Fit Score: **85%**
> - Summary: “Warm, water-resistant, but bulky”
